\usage{
LineageHomology(tree, ace_nodes, ace_tips, give_tips = NA, start_time = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Phylogenetic tree}

\item{ace_nodes}{Node probabilities in ace format.}

\item{ace_tips}{Tip probabilities in ace format}

\item{give_tips}{Taxa to do the computations for}

\item{start_time}{Date of root in the phylogeny.}
}
\value{
Import_LocalTrans contains an estimate of the number of taxa that are have changed state wrt. the state of the closest common ancestral node shared with any other taxa.

Lineage_sizes contains the number of taxa that belong to a group defined by the mapped state. This means that for the entire group, all the interal nodes will be mapped to the same state with 50% or higher probability. *Taxa names contains sub lists for each lineage, in the same order as the other lists.

MRCAâ€™s contains the time of the most recent common ancestor of the groups.

Lineage_state the state the groups are mapped to, the states are treated as numbers in the anlyses, so the relative ordering has to be looked up.
