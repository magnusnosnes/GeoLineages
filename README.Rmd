LineageHomology is an R-package that offers a set of functions for analyzing the outputs of ancestral state reconstructions. The package defines transmission lineages (TLs) and singletons based on state probabilities at each node in the reconstruction. TLs are defined as connected groups of tips where state transitions between ancestral and descendant nodes have a probability lower than 50 percent, while singletons are tips not connected to any other tips in this way. The method used in LineageHomology is similar to that introduced by [du Plessis et al. (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf2946) (DOI: 10.1126/science.abf2946). The package also provides functions to calculate the sizes of TLs, the number of singletons, estimates of importation and local transmission, and other useful summaries, as well as various plotting functions to visualize the results.

## Installation {#installation}

You can install the latest version of LineageHomology by using devtools:

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=T}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("magnusnosnes/LineageHomology")
```

## Introduction {#introduction}

This introduction provides a simple demonstration of how to apply LineageHomology to analyze outputs of an ancestral state reconstruction of simulated geographical data for two locations. We use LineageHomology to describe transmission lineages and plot the sizes and estimated time of the most recent common ancestor for each TL.

First, we simulate data and estimate the ancestral geographical states:

```{r,fig.width=11,fig.height=10,echo=T, warning=F, include=F}
set.seed(11,sample.kind = "Rounding") #11 is good
```

```{r,fig.width=11,fig.height=10,echo=T, warning=F, include=T}
library(LineageHomology)
#Loading required packages.
library(ape)
#Loading other packages for simulating data. 
library(BactDating)

#Simulate data from Norway and rest of the world
tree_test = simdatedtree(nsam=10, dateroot=2000)
tree_test = ladderize(tree_test)


```

```{r,fig.width=11,fig.height=10,echo=T, warning=F, include=F}
load(file="/Users/magnusnygardosnes/Dropbox/Rfunctions/Rpackages/LineageHomology/Examples_and_plotting_methods/Tree.Rdata") #Overwrite tree because of an issue with the RNG in rmarkdown.

```

```{r,fig.width=11,fig.height=10,echo=T, warning=F, include=T}
tiplabels=c("Sequence 7","Sequence 1","Sequence 5","Sequence 6","Sequence 4",
            "Sequence 3","Sequence 2","Sequence 9","Sequence 8","Sequence 10")
tree_test$tip.label=tiplabels
loc = c("Norway", "Norway","RoW","RoW", "RoW",
        "Norway", "Norway", "Norway", "RoW", "RoW")
names(loc) = tree_test$tip.label

#Reconstruct ancestral states using ace. 
fit1 = ace(x=loc, phy= tree_test, type="discrete", mod="ARD")
plot.phylo(tree_test,edge.width = 3,label.offset = 0.15, mar=c(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2))
axisPhylo(root.time=2000, backward=F,lwd=2)
nodelabels(pie=fit1$lik.anc,cex=0.7,piecol=c("Red","Blue"))
tips = to.matrix(loc,seq=c("Norway", "RoW"))
tiplabels(pie=tips, cex=0.7,piecol=c("Red","Blue"))
```

The tree shows the reconstructed states using the ace function in the ape package. Each node is coloured according to the probability of the location. Here red represents Norway, and blue represents the rest of the world (RoW).

![LineageHomology_procedure](./Examples_and_plotting_methods/How_it_works.png)This figure shows how LineageHomology estimates transmission lineages, singletons, importation and local transmission events. The blue-shaded background represents transmission lineages and encompasses the tips that are included in the group. The transmission lineages are defined based on a 50 percent probability of the same state on every node within the TL. The red-shaded background denotes singletons, which are unconnected to any other tips as per the rule that defines TLs. The areas showing TLs and singletons extend back to the importation date, which is the midpoint of the edge ancestral to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the TLs and the midpoint on the ancestral edge leading to the first geographical transitions for singletons. Importation dates are also indicated by blue stippled lines ending in blue dots on the time axis. Branching events are used as estimates of local transmission within transmission lineages, which is represented by red stippled lines ending in red dots on the time axis.

Next we run LineageHomology on the output from ace according to the approach outlined above.

```{r,fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
Return = LineageHomology(tree_test, ace_nodes=fit1$lik.anc,
                        ace_tips = to.matrix(loc, seq=c("Norway", "RoW")), start_time=2000)
Return
```

In this example LineageHomology returned four 3 transmission lineages. The taxa names of the tips included in each lineage is printed above under "\$Taxa_names". Lineages that only contain one tip are singletons.

The size distributions can be visualised by, e.g. using a treemap plot:

```{r,fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
LineageHomology::treemap_lineagehomology(Return)
```

The figure shows squares with areas representing the transmission lineages' sizes. The text on the squares gives the estimated time of the MRCA and the number of tips in the transmission lineages.
