#Pseudocode:
#Fint the parent nodes of all tips.
#For each tip; check for transition to its parent node
#If transition, the algorithm has found a singleton.
#If not, move on a branch up and check any new descendant emerging from the parent node.
#If any descendant is found, this is no longer a singleton but represents a local transmission event.
#If no descendants are found, this is just a singleton with a long branch.

#' LineageHomology
#' @description
#' LineageHomology takes the output of an ancestral state reconstruction method with included state probabilities at
#'  each node and counts transmission lineages (TLs). A transmission lineage is defined as a connected group of tips where state transitions between ancestral and descendant nodes
#'  that have a probability lower than 50 percent.
#' The function also counts the number of tips that are not connected to any other tips in this way (singletons).
#' The method is analogous to that introduced by du Plessis et al. (2021) (DOI: 10.1126/science.abf2946).
#' The input format should match the return format from the ape::ace function (see the help files at ?ape::ace).
#' The outputs contain descriptions of the size of TLs, singletons, and other useful summaries.
#' See the full tutorial including visualization methods at: \url{https://github.com/magnusnosnes/LineageHomology}.
#'
#' @param tree Phylogenetic tree
#' @param ace_nodes Node probabilities in ace format.
#' @param ace_tips Tip probabilities in ace format
#' @param give_tips Constrain the computations to a set of tips, e.g. all the names of the tips in a certain state (e.g. one specific geographical location).
#' @param start_time Date of root in the phylogeny.
#'
#' @return
#' @return Import_LocalTrans
#'  The first entry can be
#'  thought of as an estimate of the number of tips that have acquired their state through novel acquisition (a transition in the phylogeny).
#'  Similarly, the second number describes the number of tips that have inherited their state by inheritance (homology).
#'  Since each transmission lineage started is defined by a state transition,
#'  each transmission lineage of size n is composed of 1 novel acquisition and n-1 homologous acquisitions.
#'  Singletons are directly translated to novel acquisitions.
#' @return Lineage_sizes
#'  contains the number of tips that belong to each TL.
#'  This means that all the internal nodes will be mapped to the same state with 50 percent or higher probability for the entire TL.
#' @return Taxa_names is a list of lists where each sub list contains the names of the tips in each transmission lineage.
#' The order is the same as the listed order of the Lineage_sizes.
#' @return MRCAâ€™s
#' contains the time of the most recent common ancestor of the groups.
#' @return Halfedge_over_tmrca
#' is the time point on the middle of the edge that is ancestral to each TL's mrca.
#' This is used in analyses of importation and local transmission.
#' @return Lineage_state
#' contains the state the transmission lineages belong to,
#' the states are treated as numbers in the analyses, so the relative ordering has to be looked up.
