##### Simulate tip data with two different state.

For the purpose of this example we let the geographical states represent
Norway and the rest of the World (RoW). The package was originally
developed for data such as this.

``` r
set.seed(400)
tree_test = simdatedtree(nsam=300, dateroot=2000) #300 taxa and date of the root at year 2000-
tree_test = ladderize(tree_test) #Reorder the tree to make it look nice
Q=matrix(c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), nrow=2,ncol=2, byrow=F) #Set up a transition matrix for trait simulation
colnames(Q)=c("Norway","RoW") #From state 1 to state 2. 
rownames(Q)=c("Norway","RoW") #From state 1 to state 2. 

trait = phytools::sim.Mk(tree=tree_test,Q=Q,nsim=1) #Simulate the traits on the phylogeny

#Reconstruct ancestral states using ace. 
fit1 = ace(x=trait, phy= tree_test, type="discrete", mod="ARD") #Estimate the ancestral history

plot.phylo(tree_test,lwd=2,label.offset = 0.15, mar=c(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2),cex=0.3) #Ploy phylogeny

axisPhylo(root.time=2000, backward=F) #Add time axis

nodelabels(pie=fit1$lik.anc,cex=0.2,piecol=c("Red","Blue"))
tips = to.matrix(trait,seq=c("Norway", "RoW"))
tiplabels(pie=tips, cex=0.2,piecol=c("Red","Blue"))
```

The nodes on the phylogeny are piecharts that represents the probability
of either geographical state, where red represents Norway and blue
represents RoW. LineageHomology uses the probabilities to count
connected groups of taxa, where all the nodes on the paths between them
have a probability that &gt; 50% for the same geographical state. It
also returns the number of singletons, dates and has a number of
different plotting methods to display the results.

``` r
Result = LineageHomology(tree_test, ace_nodes=fit1$lik.anc,
                        ace_tips = to.matrix(trait, seq=c("Norway", "RoW")), start_time=2000)
```

LineageHomology outputs a list of lists.

-   Import\_LocalTrans contains an estimate of the number of taxa that
    are have changed state wrt. the state of the closest common
    ancestral node shared with any other taxa.
-   Lineage\_sizes contains the number of taxa that belong to the mapped
    state. This means that for the entire group, all the interal nodes
    will be mapped to the same state with 50% or higher probability.
    \*Taxa names contains sub lists for each lineage, in the same order
    as the other lists.
    -   Each sub list contains the taxa names of all the taxa in the
        group.
-   MRCAâ€™s contains the time of the most recent common ancestor of the
    groups.
-   Lineage\_state contains the state the groups are mapped to, the
    states are treated as numbers in the anlyses, so the relative
    ordering has to be looked up.

\#Make a treemap plot to get a quick overview of the lineages.

``` r
LineageHomology::treemap_lineagehomology(Result)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="100%" />

##### Plot lineage densities over time

``` r
#Set up matrix with taxa info
name_date = data.frame(name = names(trait), dates= BactDating::leafDates(tree_test))
Result_lineage_info = LineageHomology::lineage_info(Result,name_date)
LineageHomology::ridgeplot_lineagedensities(Result_lineage_info=Result_lineage_info,groups_larger_than = 1,datelims=c("2000-01-01","2025-01-01","3 year"),color_by_state = F)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="100%" />

##### We can color the groups by the state they are in, and restrict the plotted groups to sizes larger than 1,4, and 10

``` r
LineageHomology::ridgeplot_lineagedensities(Result_lineage_info=Result_lineage_info,groups_larger_than = 1,datelims=c("2000-01-01","2025-01-01","3 year"),color_by_state = T)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r
LineageHomology::ridgeplot_lineagedensities(Result_lineage_info=Result_lineage_info,groups_larger_than = 4,datelims=c("2000-01-01","2025-01-01","3 year"),color_by_state = T)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-2.png" width="100%" />

``` r
LineageHomology::ridgeplot_lineagedensities(Result_lineage_info=Result_lineage_info,groups_larger_than = 10,datelims=c("2000-01-01","2025-01-01","3 year"),color_by_state = T)

##### Plot cumulative lineage size over time.

``` r
LineageHomology::lineage_growth_cumulative(Result_lineage_info = Result_lineage_info, datelims=c("2000-01-01","2025-01-01","3 year"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="100%" />

##### Again we can add color to the groups by specifying it.

``` r
